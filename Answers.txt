(1)Why I designed the screens that way?
The screens were designed to follow a logical and task-oriented flow from viewing suppliers to raising 
and tracking queries. Each page focuses on a single key action, ensuring clarity and ease of navigation.
The color-coded status indicators and consistent layout help QA managers quickly understand query 
progress at a glance.




(2)How I made it simple for the user?
The interface was structured with minimal visual clutter, clear typography, and intuitive button placement.
 Forms use clear field labels, dropdowns, and predefined options to reduce input effort. 
 Consistent icons, accessible colors, and readable text enhance usability for all users, making the 
 overall experience smooth and efficient.
